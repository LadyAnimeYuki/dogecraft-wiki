# General chat rules

1. Breaking rules will result in warnings/muted/kicked/tempban/permaban. Please see Punishment Guide for more details.
2. Listen to staff. Anyone with a staff title are equal in "being staff". Arguing with Helpers "just because they are not admins" is not a valid excuse. They know the rules and are following the guidelines. If you feel staff was wrong, abusive or have an issue with the decision made please make a post on the forums or contact an Admin.
3. Respect each other. Example if they ask you to change the subject PLEASE do so. Please don't name call.
4. Chat is usually kept PG13. Let's keep chat mostly clean and family friendly. Please keep role playing to PMs or party chats. 
5. No advertising. No Youtube/minecraft servers/discords. Period. This will result in a tempban and chat clear.
6. Harassing other players/abuse/hate speech/discriminatory speech will not be tolerated. Do NOT use the "n" word. This is a PERMABAN. Aimed at someone or not. Circumventing/misspelling/naming items ALSO results in PermaBan. Usage of slurs or speaking in a racist way will get you banned.
7. Chat may be cleared if the above rule is broken or any hate/discrimination is used. 
8. Light swearing is allowed but do not aim it at other people.
9. Do not spam. This includes:<br>
the same message over and over<br>
flooding chat - one word per message sent very quickly<br>
excessive character spam - "Nooooo" "no!!!!!!!!!!!!" "no?!?!!?!???!!??"<br>
caps - "NOOOO"<br>

Use of the above will get you warned and then muted, after that its tempban/ban. Trying to AVOID these rules "because it isn't in the rules" will be handled like other rule breaking, a verbal warning followed by a warning or muting.<br>
Please try to use the "less than 5" of the same character in a message concept. - Nooo/NOO. 
While you still might be asked to stop it's less likely to get you in trouble.
10. Spamming also includes PARTICIPATING or clearly trying to initiate spam. Exception is 'f' for deaths and 'gg'.
11. Please do not intentionally give players false/fake information. "Alt + f4" is not how to craft anything. 
12. Please do not /ignore staff or trusted players as you will not see their verbal warnings and may end up being /warned for chat rule violations.
13. Please do not talk about killing yourself, in game or otherwise, this makes everyone uncomfortable. Please contact a suicide hotline if you feel you need help. 
14. If you are MUTED in game please do NOT talk through the discord in the survival/slimefun channels. This is mute evasion and you will have your discord perms removed. 
15. Likewise if you have someone /ignored please don't go on the discord to talk to them through the survival channel.
16. If you have issues with another player please contact staff. Do NOT contact the other player OUTSIDE of minecraft. This is NOT okay. Please come to staff to help resolve the issue. Harassment OUTSIDE of game and INSIDE of game are taken very seriously. 
17. Even as a joke please do not talk about demoting staff, if you have a complaint please take it to the discord or the forums. Arguing in game against a staff member will only escalate your punishment faster. 
18. Please avoid naming items, tools or weapons anything that would violate the general chat rules. This includes keeping it pg13, when in doubt please pick a more family friendly name. We may ask you to rename the item if we feel it doesn't comply with the rules. 
19. English only in main chat please. Keep other languages to pms or party chat.
