# General chat rules

1. Breaking rules will result in warnings/muted/kicked/tempban/permaban. Please see Punishment Guide for more details.
2. Listen to staff. Anyone with a staff title are equal in "being staff". Arguing with Helpers "just because they are not admins" is not a valid excuse. They know the rules and are following the guidelines. If you feel staff was wrong, abusive or have an issue with the decision made please make a post on the forums or contact an Admin.
3. Respect each other. Example if they ask you to change the subject PLEASE do so. Please don't name call.
4. Chat is usually kept PG13. Let's keep chat mostly clean and family friendly. Please keep role playing to PMs or party chats. 
5. No advertising. No Youtube/minecraft servers/discords. Period. This will result in a tempban and chat clear.
6. Harassing other players/abuse/hate speech/discriminatory speech will not be tolerated. Do NOT use the "n" word. This is a PERMABAN. Aimed at someone or not. Circumventing/misspelling/naming items ALSO results in PermaBan. Usage of slurs or speaking in a racist way will get you banned.
7. Chat may be cleared if the above rule is broken or any hate/discrimination is used. 
8. Light swearing is allowed but do not aim it at other people.
9. Do not spam. This includes:
the same message over and over
flooding chat - one word per message sent very quickly
excessive character spam - "Nooooo" "no!!!!!!!!!!!!" "no?!?!!?!???!!??"
caps - "NOOOO"
T a l k i n g  l i k e  t h i s  i s  t e c h n i c a l l y  s p a m
BeCaUsE iT gEtS yOu MoRe AtTeNiTiOn
Use of the above will get you warned and then muted, after that its tempban/ban. 
Please try to use the "less than 5" of the same character in a message concept. - Nooo/NOO. 
While you still might be asked to stop it's less likely to get you in trouble.
10. Spamming also includes PARTICIPATING or clearly trying to initiate spam. Exception is 'f' for deaths and 'gg'.
11. Please do not intentionally give players false/fake information. "Alt + f4" is not how to craft anything. 
12. Please do not /ignore staff or trusted players as you will not see their verbal warnings and may end up being /warned for chat rule violations.
13. Please do not talk about killing yourself, in game or otherwise, this makes everyone uncomfortable. Please contact a suicide hotline if you feel you need help.
