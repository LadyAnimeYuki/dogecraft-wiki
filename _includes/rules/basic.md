## Traps 
Any redstone device that harms a player is not allowed this also includes large holes that are not properly secured. Teleporting a player and killing them is also not permited. 
## Griefing & Stealing
You may not alter any building/plot, or town that does not belong to you without consent. The alterations include but are not limited to: Placing or destroying blocks Taking items from any container Placing or dropping any unwanted items in hoppers Spawning unwanted animals or mobs Claiming a plot without the consent of the mayor (Unless otherwise stated in the town rules) Using your res admin or Assistant powers to commit any crime Scamming in general is not allowed and may result in a ban. 

## Trespassing
Trespassing is the act of entering private property without permission. The plot must have no access with standard permissions unless otherwise stated by signs. Alternatively, a player can be asked to leave and if they don't, it's considered trespassing. To prevent trespassing, one can toggle their town to private or close off their plot with all perms off. Illegal grinder usage also falls under trespassing. The grinder must be closed off and have clearly posted signs stating who is or isn’t allowed to use the grinder. If the grinder is open and no signs are placed, then it will not be considered trespassing until they are asked to leave. If you do not want certain people to enter your town, place signs at the town spawn listing their names, if this person is still on your land without permission ask for Staff to politely tell them to get of your town property. Under any circumstances you do not enable PVP. 

## Trespassing
If renting a shop, it is your responsibility to keep it rented-- If it becomes unrented, a player is permitted to rent the shop, claim all its contents, and are not required to return the items to its original owner. If the shop that you rented has locked chests call an Admin+ to unlock them for you 

## ALT-Account

## Grinders & Hoppers
Automatic farms with Spawners are not allowed (allowed if no spawners are used) Afk-Pools are not allowed.

## Auto-Clickers/Scripts
Any usage of an Auto-Clicker/Script is NOT ALLOWED if not present at your computer.

## Mods/Hacks
Do not X-Ray or use other advantage giving mods (example: Killaura,Anti-KB). If you’re unsure of a mod, consult staff for review before use. (Saying you did not know this rule does not backup your ban appeal)

## Listen to Staff
Asking for us to give you staff in chat without making an application is not allowed. Staff might not always be right but they are always trying to help reach in their direction for any feedback that might not be clear from the rules. In cases where these rules are unclear or incomplete, defer to staff judgement.
