# General Rules

## Common Sense 
1. We do not allow duping. Of any kind. 
2. Listen to staff. Rules are a guideline. Staff enforce the rules. A nice staff member may forgive your spam, don't expect the next one ( or even the same one ) to forgive you next time. 
3. Report glitches you find to staff. Do not ABUSE them. 
4. Report issues to STAFF. Do NOT take matters into your own hands to resolve grief etc.

## Alt Accounts 
1. Do not use more than 2 accounts on the server at one time. More than 2 will get you and the other accounts banned. If you avoid this ban you will be permabanned. 
2. Free accounts - please understand that these are technically against Mojangs rules. If you are on a free account you might lose access to that account. This is not OUR fault or problem. There is nothing we can do to help you. We will not give you items from that account. We will not be able to give you access to cshops from the other accounts etc. This is also for your protection as we cannot be certain who the account really belongs to. Please do yourself a favor and get a legitimate Minecraft account. 
3. If your main account is banned and you use an alt this is called ban evasion. Your temp ban will now be permaban.

## Inactive
1. If you are inactive for 30 days or more people may request that your residence or other property be removed.
2. Your land and items may be rolled back or given away at this point. This is more likely to happen on pieces of land that are nearly barren/empty. 
3. This is up to staff discretion but only Admin and above can change/remove/alter the actual residence.
4. Extended AFKing ( as determined by staff ) will result in a kick. Repeat offenders will receive a warning and escalation from there. NOTE this is not "AFK at grinders" this is just afk in lobby or other places. See survival rules for more info on other afk offenses. 

## Mods/Texturepacks
1. Any use of the above that gives you an advantage over others is not allowed. If you have questions about particular ones please ask before using them.
2. NO XRAY.


## Staff
1. Staff follow a guidelines their judgement "if you are spamming" is on a case by case scenario but all follow the same general guide, they will inform you/act accordingly. Doesn't matter their rank.  
2. Do not ASK FOR STAFF. If you would like a staff position please check our forums and put in an application. The requirements for staff are that you need to be at least 16 years of age and have played on the server for at least two weeks. However, the longer you play, the more you become a helpful player, the more you know our community the better your chances are. Exceptions may be made to this but it's on a case by case situation. 
3. The owner is a very busy person. If you have a question please ask another staff member if they are available. As cool as your house or build might be the owner is likely working hard to fix server issues. 
4. Please contact the Manager ( LadyAnime ) if you need help finding the right staff member to talk to or if you think you really do need the owner. Another way to contact staff for emergencies is to do /discord and tell us about the issue in our #support channel.
5. Good idea or suggestions? Please contact the Manager or submit it to our forums.
6. While staff is here to help, we are not certified counselors, if you need help with an IRL problem please do not expect staff to be able to solve these issues.
