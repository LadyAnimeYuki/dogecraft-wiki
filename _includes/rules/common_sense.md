## Alt Accounts 
1. Do not use more than 2 accounts on the server at one time. More than 2 will get you and the other accounts banned. If you avoid this ban you will be permabanned. 
2. Free accounts - please understand that these are technically against Mojangs rules. If you are on a free account you might lose access to that account. This is not OUR fault or problem. There is nothing we can do to help you. We will not give you items from that account. We will not be able to give you access to cshops from the other accounts etc. This is also for your protection as we cannot be certain who the account really belongs to. Please do yourself a favor and get a legitimate Minecraft account. 

## Mods/Texturepacks
1. Any use of the above that gives you an advantage over others is not allowed. If you have questions about particular ones please ask before using them.
2. NO XRAY.



## Staff
1. Staff follow a guidelines their judgement "if you are spamming" is on a case by case scenario but all follow the same general guide, they will inform you/act accordingly. Doesn't matter their rank.  
2. Do not ASK FOR STAFF. If you would like a staff position please check our forums and put in an application. The requirements for staff are that you need to be at least 16 years of age and have played on the server for at least two weeks. However, the longer you play, the more you become a helpful player, the more you know our community the better your chances are. Exceptions may be made to this but it's on a case by case situation. 
3. The owner is a very busy person. If you have a question please ask another staff member if they are available. As cool as your house or build might be the owner is likely working hard to fix server issues. 
4. Please contact the Manager ( LadyAnime ) if you need help finding the right staff member to talk to or if you think you really do need the owner. Another way to contact staff for emergencies is to do /discord and tell us about the issue in our #support channel.
5. Good idea or suggestions? Please contact the Manager or submit it to our forums.
6. While staff is here to help, we are not certified counselors, if you need help with an IRL problem please do not expect staff to be able to solve these issues.


## Trapping
1. Do NOT build things or devices that trap/harm or kill a player. This includes giant holes without securing them or teleporting a player and killing them. 
2. Giant holes ARE allowed just please prevent players from dying/tping there. Give them a way out if it isn't secured.
3. Giant holes ARE allowed in resource without protecting them. Please watch your step. 

## Griefing/Stealing
1. Not allowed. Period. Even if the items are "unprotected". If it isn't your item or build leave it alone. 
2. The above includes placing blocks, taking blocks, spawning unwanted mobs, claiming a plot without consent ( if it's in a town ).
3. Scamming is NOT allowed. If you agree to a trade or price the items and money need to be exchanged. Violating this may result in a ban. 
4. If you find someone's items feel free to place it in a chest where they died.

## Trespassing
1. Trespassing is entering private property without permission. The plot must have no standard access unless otherwise stated by signs 
2. Illegal use of private grinders is also trespassing. If you can teleport there and there are no signs against it then it is likely a public or open grinder.
3. If you are asked to leave a property please do so. 
4. Please do "/res pset -username- tp false" and/or "/res pset -username- move false" while standing in your res to prevent that player from coming to your res.
5. Do not enable PvP to try and resolve trespassing. Please contact staff.
6. Trespassing / harassment also covers if someone is physically following you around. If you ask them to leave and they don't please contact a staff member. This is also known as STALKING.


## Encroachment
1. Our world is a limited size at the moment, when able please ask before claiming land in-between someones claims. This is a common courtesy issue.
2. IF you box someone in on all sides so they cannot expand their res at all you may be asked to delete your claim.

## Grinders, Hoppers, auto-clickers, auto farms
1. Auto farms/grinders with spawners are NOT allowed. Auto farms are allowed if there are no spawners involved. Please make auto farms toggle if you can and do not afk at them. 
2. Afk pools are not allowed that includes methods that prevent you from being kicked while afk. You may be kicked or tempbanned.
3. Auto-clickers are okay but you MUST be present at your computer. If caught afk you may be moved if you do not respond within 30 seconds-1minute while using an auto-clicker you will be warned/kicked.
4. 0 tick farms are not allowed. This is basically duping.
5. Automatic Iron golem farms are allowed. Please turn them off when not in use. NO spawners would be allowed to be involved in this. 
6. Redstone clocks that do not cause lag are allowed. Please turn them off when not in use. 
7. Building on top of the nether for gold farms is allowed. 
8. Auto fish farms are not allowed.
9. Auto smelters are allowed. Please toggle when not in use.


## Market Rules
1. If you are renting a shop and it becomes unpaid/unrented another player can rent it. They will be able to claim all the items left inside and do not have to return them. This may also happen if you OWN a shop and become inactive - 3 or more months of not logging in.
2. If you own a market plot please have at least ONE valid cshop. Advertising for other res' or shops is permitted in your shop on signs etc.
3. Please do not spam chat with your shop tp. 
4. You can sell things to other players in a few ways such as /cshop, /ah.
To sell in the auction house ( /ah ) please hold the item in your hand and do /ah sell -price- -amount- 
For chest shop ( /cshop ) please hold the item in your hand and do /cshop create [amout] [price] [buy back]. You can use 0 as a placeholder to hide either [price] or [buy back] not both. Then right click the chest with the item. Example "/cshop create 64 1 0" will sell a stack of the item for 1 dollar and will not buy it back. 
SPECIAL NOTE: When selling spawners please follow the steps above but do NOT click the chest with the item. After hitting enter for the command ( while still holding the item ) switch to a free hand and right click the chest. 
5. Please use common sense when pricing items. No one will buy a baked potatoes for 1mil. Thank you.
