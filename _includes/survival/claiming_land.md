# Claiming land

Land Protector item is how you claim land. It is a wooden hoe.<br>
Left click one corner of your property. Right click the OPPOSITE side. <br>
Type the command “/res create NAME”.<br>
Type “/res info” to make sure it doesn’t say “invalid residence” if it said invalid it didn’t claim the land. <br>
Requirements for claiming land: The land must be unclaimed for this to work. It does cost a small fee depending on how many blocks you claim. You can only have so many “residences” as per your rank/donation rank.<br>
