# Claiming land

1. You are given a "land protector" - this is how you claim land.
2. Simply hold it in your hand. Left click one corner of your property. Right click the OPPOSITE side. ( Imagine making a big square of protection ). Type the command "/res create NAME" with whatever you want to name it in place of NAME. 
3. Type "/res info" to make sure it doesn't say "invalid residence" if it said invalid it didn't claim the land. Try again.
4. Requirements for claiming land:
The land must be unclaimed for this to work.
It does cost a small fee depending on how many blocks you claim. 
You can only have so many "residences" as per your rank/donation rank.
