## Survival Rules

## Trapping
1. Do NOT build things or devices that trap/harm or kill a player. This includes giant holes without securing them or teleporting a player and killing them. 
2. Giant holes ARE allowed just please prevent players from dying/tping there. Give them a way out if it isn't secured.
3. Giant holes ARE allowed in resource without protecting them. Please watch your step. 

## Griefing/Stealing
1. Not allowed. Period. Even if the items are "unprotected". If it isn't your item or build leave it alone. 
2. The above includes placing blocks, taking blocks, spawning unwanted mobs, claiming a plot without consent ( if it's in a town ).
3. Scamming is NOT allowed. If you agree to a trade or price the items and money need to be exchanged. Violating this may result in a ban. 
4. If you find someone's items feel free to place it in a chest where they died.

## Trespassing
1. Trespassing is entering private property without permission. The plot must have no standard access unless otherwise stated by signs 
2. Illegal use of private grinders is also trespassing. If you can teleport there and there are no signs against it then it is likely a public or open grinder.
3. If you are asked to leave a property please do so. 
4. Please do "/res pset -username- tp false" and/or "/res pset -username- move false" while standing in your res to prevent that player from coming to your res.
5. Do not enable PvP to try and resolve trespassing. Please contact staff.
6. Trespassing / harassment also covers if someone is physically following you around. If you ask them to leave and they don't please contact a staff member. This is also known as STALKING.

## Encroachment
1. Our world is a limited size at the moment, when able please ask before claiming land in-between someones claims. This is a common courtesy issue.
2. If you box someone in on all sides so they cannot expand their res at all you may be asked to delete your claim.

## Grinders, Hoppers, auto-clickers, auto farms
1. Auto farms/grinders with spawners are NOT allowed. Auto farms are allowed if there are no spawners involved. Please make auto farms toggle if you can and do not afk at them. 
2. Afk pools are not allowed that includes methods that prevent you from being kicked while afk. You may be kicked or tempbanned.
3. Auto-clickers are okay but you MUST be present at your computer. If caught afk you may be moved if you do not respond within 30 seconds-1minute while using an auto-clicker you will be warned/kicked.
4. 0 tick farms are not allowed. This is basically duping.
5. Automatic Iron golem farms are allowed. Please turn them off when not in use. NO spawners would be allowed to be involved in this. 
6. Redstone clocks that do not cause lag are allowed. Please turn them off when not in use. 
7. Building on top of the nether for gold farms is allowed. 
8. Auto fish farms are not allowed.
9. Auto smelters are allowed. Please toggle when not in use.

## Market Rules
1. If you are renting a shop and it becomes unpaid/unrented another player can rent it. They will be able to claim all the items left inside and do not have to return them. This may also happen if you OWN a shop and become inactive - 3 or more months of not logging in.
2. If you own a market plot please have at least ONE valid cshop. Advertising for other res' or shops is permitted in your shop on signs etc.
3. Please do not spam chat with your shop tp. 
4. You can sell things to other players in a few ways such as /cshop, /ah.
To sell in the auction house ( /ah ) please hold the item in your hand and do /ah sell -price- -amount- 
For chest shop ( /cshop ) please hold the item in your hand and do /cshop create [amout] [price] [buy back]. You can use 0 as a placeholder to hide either [price] or [buy back] not both. Then right click the chest with the item. Example "/cshop create 64 1 0" will sell a stack of the item for 1 dollar and will not buy it back. 
SPECIAL NOTE: When selling spawners please follow the steps above but do NOT click the chest with the item. After hitting enter for the command ( while still holding the item ) switch to a free hand and right click the chest. 
5. Please use common sense when pricing items. No one will buy a baked potatoes for 1mil. Thank you.
